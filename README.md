Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition:

This project aims to develop a real-time traffic sign recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for autonomous driving applications. The goal is to enhance road safety by accurately detecting and classifying traffic signs from a live video feed with high accuracy and low latency.




Key Goals:

Accuracy: Achieve over 95% classification accuracy on the test set.


Performance: Process video with a latency below 50ms per frame.


Deployment: Create an optimized model ready for embedded systems.



Demonstration: Successfully run the system using a live video feed.


Tech Stack:

Software: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV.


Dataset: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB).
